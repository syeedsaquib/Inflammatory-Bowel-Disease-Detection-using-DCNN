## Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract and is divided into Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. It occurs in genetically susceptible individuals after an exaggerated immune response to a normal stimulus, such as food and intestinal flora. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of inflammatory bowel disease and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition

### Crohn’s disease

Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can cause inflammation anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Inflammation can cause redness, swelling and pain, and is the body’s response to injury or irritation.
